    "# STYLE TRANSFER\n",
    "### In this project we are going to be using Convolutional Neural Networks to implement Neural Style Transfer, a technique for creating a new image with the contenet of one input image and the style of another input. The idea behind style transfer is as follows: take three input images, one our style image, one our content image, and one output image which starts as random noise and we iteratively update it until it looks like the content of the content image in the style of the style image. To do this we run all three images through a pretrained VGG16 model trained to classify images. Then for a selected convolutional or pooling layer of the VGG16 model we compare the activations (values of the neurons) at that layer for the three different images. Specifically, we have what is called a feature reconstruction loss that compares the activations of the current output image and the content image, and what is called a style loss that compares the activations of the current output image and the desired style image. Then we use the gradient of these loss functions to update our current output image. Hopefully, that gives you an overview of what we will be doing, and you should gain a more in depth understanding as we go along.  \n",
